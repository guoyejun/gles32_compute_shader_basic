I searched and did not find a complete code example of compute shader, so I publicized here when I finished it. And it is also a record in case that I myself may need it some time later.

It is verifiedy on Android O, i think it is easy to be ported to other systems

Steps to build within Andriod source tree.

1. cd your_path_to_android/frameworks/native/opengl/tests/

2. modify Android.bp as:
--- a/opengl/tests/Android.bp
+++ b/opengl/tests/Android.bp

 subdirs = [
     "angeles",
+    "gles32_compute_shader_basic",
     "configdump",
     "EGLTest",
     "fillrate",

3. git clone https://github.com/guoyejun/gles32_compute_shader_basic.git

4. cd gles32_compute_shader_basic

5. mm
