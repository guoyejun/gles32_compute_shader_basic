I searched and did not find a complete code example of compute shader, so I publicized here when I finished it. And it is also a record in case that I myself may need it some time later.


To build within Linux, just run 'make'.
If there's build issue, try to install the necessary libraries, such as the following:
apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev


Steps to build within Andriod source tree.
1. cd your_path_to_android/frameworks/native/opengl/tests/

2. modify Android.bp as:
--- a/opengl/tests/Android.bp

3. git clone https://github.com/guoyejun/gles32_compute_shader_basic.git
